## 🛍️ Olist Customer Segmentation Project

This project analyzes customer behavior using the Olist e-commerce dataset.  
It focuses on identifying and comparing:

- Top 10 customers by **total spending**
- Top 10 customers by **total number of orders**

## 📌 Key Insight
> High-spending customers are **not always** frequent buyers.

This helps businesses to understand that **loyalty ≠ profitability** and tailor campaigns accordingly.
